# React-Clicky-Game

Clicky game is a memory game where the objective is to click all 12 photos without clicking a photo twice. Each time you click a photo, the order of the images are randomly shuffled around.

As an avid Boston sports fan, I decided to make the game Red Sox themed with the pictures being players on their 2018-2019 defending World Champions roster. Yankees suck.

To get started, just click a Sox player!
