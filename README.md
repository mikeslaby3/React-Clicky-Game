# React-Clicky-Game

Memory game where the objective is to click all 12 photos without clicking the same photo twice. Each time you click an image, the order is randomly shuffled around.

As an avid Boston sports fan, I decided to make the game Red Sox themed with the pictures being players on their 2018-2019 defending World Champions roster.

To get started, just click a Sox player! (No Yankees fans allowed)
